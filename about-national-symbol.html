					<br>
					The mosque has several modern architectural features whilst at the same time it preserves the traditional principles of Mughal architecture which has 
					for some time been dominant in the Indian sub-continent. Baitul Mukarram's large cube shape was modeled to that of the Ka'abah at Mecca making it a 
					noticeable structure being unlike any other mosque in Bangladesh.
					<br>
					<br>
					The mosque complex was designed by architect, Abdulhusein M. Thariani. In 1959, owner of then Bawany Jute Mills, Haji Abdul Latif Bawany proposed 
					to Major General Omrao Khan, then military administrator of East Pakistan, of building a grande mosque in Dhaka. Omrao Khan agreed to help on building 
					such mosque. Same year, 'Baitul Mukarram mosque committee' had been established and 8.30 acre of land between new Dhaka and old Dhaka had been chosen. 
					At that time, there was a large pond in present mosque's location. It was known as 'Paltan pond. The pond was filled up and on 27 January 1960 then 
					president of Pakistan Ayub Khan commenced the work. Pray for first time took place on Friday, 25 January 1963.
