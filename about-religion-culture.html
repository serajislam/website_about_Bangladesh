	 		 Christians make up another 1% of Bangladesh's population. The majority are 	 part of the Roman Catholic Church.

			pray for peace and prosperity after Eid congregations – or jamaats, as they are commonly referred to.
			<br>
			<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
			On Eid day, the Eid prayers are held all over the country, in open areas like fields, Eidgahs or inside mosques. After the Eid prayers, people return home,
			visit each other's home and eat sweet dishes called Shirini, Sheer Khurma and other delicacies like biryani, korma, haleem, kebab etc.It is also customary 
			for junior members of the society to touch the feet of the seniors, and seniors returning blessings(sum of money as a gift). Money and food is donated to

				<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspA Bengali wedding includes many rituals and ceremonies that can span several days. In most cases, it starts with the Kabin ceremony 
				(the official registration of the wedding and presenting Denmohor or Mahr) and ends with the Bou Bhat ceremony (the wedding reception, 
				a day after the marriage, usually arranged by the groom's family).
				<br>
				<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

				Settle marriage is popular in Bangladesh. Once the guardians (only) of bride and grooms settled such relation and the bride and groom’s opinions had 
				minor priority. Now a day the situations has been improved and given the priority of bride and bride groom likes. Muslim faith based Bangladeshi society
				accepts the newly culture and made own form with the traditional customs of old and new practices. The Bangladeshi particularly middle class bride and 
				bride groom want to start the family life with joy. Bangladeshis are believed to be protective band forever and almost all bride and bride groom perform 
				faith to each other in the next portion of life. They invite all friends, neighbors and relatives as much possible on the weeding festival. Bangladeshi 
				weeding ceremony has its own tradition and customs for days long.
				<br>
				<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
				A traditional wedding is arranged by Ghotoks (matchmakers), who are generally friends or relatives of the couple. The matchmakers facilitate the 
				introduction, and also help agree the amount of any settlement. In Muslim marriages another settlement to make which is called 'Mahr' or 'Kabin' 
				to be paid by the groom to the bride - which is a religious requirement.
				<br>
				<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
				Bengali weddings are traditionally in four parts: the bride's gaye holud, the groom's gaye holud, the wedding ceremony, and the reception. 
				These often take place on separate days. The first event in a wedding is an informal one: the groom presents the bride with a ring marking the 
				"engagement" which is gaining popularity. This can sometimes be considered as Ashirwaad.

				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor a Muslim wedding, the bride and groom are seated separately, and a kazi (person authorized by the government to perform the wedding), 
				accompanied by the parents and a witness (Bengali: ওয়াকিল wakil) from each side formally asks the bride for her consent to the union, and then 
				the groom for his.
				<br>
				<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
				At this time, for Muslim weddings, the amount of the dowry or mahr is verified, and if all is well, the formal papers are signed, and the couple are 
				seated side by side on a dais. The bride's veil (Bengali: ওরনা or ঘোমটা orna/ghomṭa) is draped over both the bride and groom, and a mirror is placed in 
				front of them. The groom is then supposed to say something romantic on what he sees in the mirror—notionally the first time he has laid eyes on his bride.
				A traditional answer is to say that he has seen the moon. The bride and groom then feed each other sweets, while the bride's family members try to push 
				the groom's face into the food. All the guests then celebrate the union with a feast. Below some image of Muslims marriage........
