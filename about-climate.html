<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Bangladesh is located next to eastern India, at the head of the Bay of Bengal. The country is very low-lying; other than the hilly district around 
Chittagong in the southeast, most of the country lies below 600 ft (180m). Due to the delta of the rivers Ganges and Brahmaputra, much of Bangladesh's 
terrain is swampy plains.
</p>

<p><br> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Bangladesh is one of the Climate Asia countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. While Bangladeshis are already used to facing cyclones
and floods, they now also experience higher temperatures, lower rainfall and less predictable weather compared with 10 years ago. People feel that the 
effects of these changes on their livelihoods and health are being exacerbated by human activity such as migration to cities and fertiliser use.
</p>

<p><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
The climate of Bangladesh is tropical, with a pleasantly warm and sunny winter from November to February, a short hot spring between March and May, 
and a long rainy season from June to October, due to the summer monsoon.Three seasons are generally recognized: a hot, humid summer from March to June; 
a cool, rainy monsoon season from June to October; and a cool, dry winter from October to March. In general, maximum summer temperatures range between 32°C 
and 38°C. April is the warmest month in most parts of the country. January is the coldest month, when the average temperature for most of the country is 
10°C.
</p>

<p><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
During winter, from December to February, sometimes the north wind can bring cold temperatures at night, around 3/6 °C (37/43 °F) in the north, and around 
10 °C (50 °F) in the centre-south and in Dhaka. In February the temperature begins to rise, and from March it begins to get really hot. Spring, 
from March to May, is actually the hottest season: the average maximum temperatures reach 35 °C (95 °F) in April in inland areas, while they don't go 
above 32/33 °C (90/91 °F) along the coast, where the hottest month, for the natural thermal inertia of the ocean, is May. The highest peaks are about 
42/43 °C (108/109 °F) in the north, 40 °C (104 °F) in Dhaka and in the centre, and 37/38 °C (99/100 °F) in the south. Relative humidity gradually 
increases, and the heat becomes more stifling. In this season, lines of thunderstorms coming from the Himalayas, called northwesters, bring rain 
accompanied with hail and wind gusts, so that in May more than 250 millimetres (10 inches) of rain fall in the south and 150 mm (6 in) in the north.
</p>
<p><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Winds are mostly from the north and northwest in the winter, blowing gently at one to three kilometers per hour in northern and central areas and 
three to six kilometers per hour near the coast. From March to May, violent thunderstorms, called northwesters by local English speakers, produce 
winds of up to sixty kilometers per hour. During the intense storms of the early summer and late monsoon season, southerly winds of more than 160 
kilometers per hour cause waves to crest as high as 6 meters in the Bay of Bengal, which brings disastrous flooding to coastal areas.

</p>
<p><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	
Heavy rainfall is characteristic of Bangladesh. With the exception of the relatively dry western region of Rajshahi, where the annual rainfall is about 
160 centimeters, most parts of the country receive at least 200 centimeters of rainfall per year (see fig. 1). Because of its location just south of the 
foothills of the Himalayas, where monsoon winds turn west and northwest, the region of Sylhet in northeastern Bangladesh receives the greatest average 
precipitation. From 1977 to 1986, annual rainfall in that region ranged between 328 and 478 centimeters per year. Average daily humidity ranged from March 
lows of between 45 and 71 percent to July highs of between 84 and 92 percent, based on readings taken at selected stations nationwide in 1986.
</p>

<p><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
About 80 percent of Bangladesh's rain falls during the monsoon season. The monsoons result from the contrasts between low and high air pressure areas that
result from differential heating of land and water. During the hot months of April and May hot air rises over the Indian subcontinent, creating 
low-pressure areas into which rush cooler, moisture-bearing winds from the Indian Ocean. This is the southwest monsoon, commencing in June and usually 
lasting through September. Dividing against the Indian landmass, the monsoon flows in two branches, one of which strikes western India. The other travels
up the Bay of Bengal and over eastern India and Bangladesh, crossing the plain to the north and northeast before being turned to the west and northwest by
the foothills of the Himalayas.
</p>

<p><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, which come from the Bay of Bengal, usually from mid-April to early December. In general, 
they are most intense both at the beginning and the end of the period, that is, in May-June and October-November. The most destructive cyclone on record
